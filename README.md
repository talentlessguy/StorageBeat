* StoragePerf. Benchmarks and performance testing methodology for centralised and decentralised storage.
* Storage Pricing. Unified price comparison for perpetual and expiring storage.
* Storage Guarantees. Cryptographic and social promises.

## Target audience

Our archetypal target audience is a CTO choosing a storage backend to deploy a service that will allow users to download data from different geographic locations. The CTO manages a geographically distributed and async team, so he cares about performance and reliability at all times of day in multiple geographic regions.

### Why not some other audience?

Other target audiences we choose to put aside:

1. A lead engineer choosing a storage platform on which to build an application. (This is slightly different because the engineer need not use an end-to-end service but simply integrate components.)
2. A consumer wishing to back up his squirrel videos. (We believe this type of target market is generally far enough removed from the details of storage backend so as to make presenting this type of information irrelevant; what the user cares about is the performance and features of *applications*, not backends.)
